# Introduction to Agricultural Informatics

We will overview current and emerging technologies used in digital agriculture. You will be engaged in learning technology fundamentals (languages, concepts, methods), through seven 2-week projects. These hands-on exercises will allow you to gain a practical understanding of the technology itself, review research and development trends, and debate opportunities and challenges presented by each technology. This course will equip you with basic computational thinking and software development skills for Agricultural Informatics careers.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this course, you will be able to:

1. Demonstrate an understanding of informatics challenges in food and agricultural systems.
2. Develop programming skills to create scripts and web applications to explore, store, manipulate, and view food and agriculture data.
3. Develop computational thinking skills to select appropriate informatics approaches and digital technologies to solve a range of challenges in food and agricultural systems.
4. Conceptualize an informatics solution to solving an open food system or agricultural challenge.

# Course Communications
**Course Materials:** This github repository will contain links to all slides, labs, etc. I will release each module's content one or two weeks at a time.

**Course Discussion:** Join the course slack channel to chat with the instructors and students at both Purdue & Uni of Kentucky, where the course is being co-taught. [**Join the Slack Channel**](https://join.slack.com/t/learn-ag-informatics/shared_invite/zt-tnsofjro-QbFiz2j4k2C_1MbwxEZrQA)

**Student Consultations:** Make appointments with me via email or slack.

## Purdue Instructor: Ankita Raturi
**Slack:** Contact @sudoktia via Slack direct message for quick responses. If it's a question/comment others can benefit from, consider using the more general channels. I aim to respond within 24 hours to Slack messages.

**Email:** Contact **ankita@purdue.edu** with the email subject: **[ASM 591 AGINF]** for better indexing. Reserve use of email for long and/or complex communications. I aim to respond to email within 48 hours.

**Office:** ABE Building, Room 4031K. For in-person consultations, make an appointment first. In case we can't meet in person, we will use WebEx for a video-call meeting, as agreed upon via email. I aim to provide in-person appointments within 1 week of your request.

## Purdue Logistics
**Lectures:** ABE 1144. Tuesdays & Thursdays @ 11.30am - 12.30pm. These will be recorded and made available online if possible. 

**Labs:** ABE 2098. Thursdays, 1.30pm - 3.20pm. If you have a scheduling conflict, I expect you to complete the labs in your own time.

# Course Structure & Schedule
This course is divided into eight 2 week modules. Each module is structured approximately as follows:

- **Week 1:**
  - **Lecture 1 - Ankita:** introduces the topic of the module. This will be discussion-based synchronous lecture. 
  - **Lecture 2 - Video(s):** introduces the skills required for the module. Typically a link to video(s) that you can watch in your own time. I will be available in the lecture room in case you have questions, or want to discuss any concepts.
  - **Lab Part 1:** apply the introductory skills and concepts learned in week 1.
  - **Quiz:** quick knowledge evaluation in the form of short, multiple choice questions via Brightspace.
- Week 2:
  - **Lecture 3 - Guest:** this will typically be a guest lecture. Depending on the guest's availability, it may be swapped with lecture 4. These will typically give you insight into how the module topic is practices in industry or research.
  - **Lecture 4 - Ankita:** I will typically bookend the module with a discussion/demonstration of how the skills/concepts apply to problems in food and agriculture systems.
  - **Lab Part 2:** building on the previous lab, you will apply the skills/concepts in the context of food and agricultural data/challenges.

  The full course schedule is described below. If you click on each module, you will see details on the lectures, labs, and the quiz.

## Course Assessments

**Quizzes** will be available on Brightspace the Monday before they are due. They 7 quizzes, due every 2 weeks. The quiz will automatically close at 5pm, Fridays, on the due dates listed below. Quizzes are multiple choice/short answer, and will be autgraded. These are intended to serve as "participation" checks, and hopefully help you evaluate how you're coping with the course. 

**Labs** will be available on Github every Monday. Each lab is due at the start of the next 2 week module. Each lab will come with submission instructions, but I will generally expect a timestamp of no later than 5pm the day it is due. There will be a 5 hour no-penalty grace period in case you have technical difficulties with submission. <!-- **Grading Note:** There are 8 labs in total. You can either do all 8 and I'll drop the lowest grade, skip one with no grade penalty (since I only count 7). Labs are graded based on your ability to demonstrate successful completion of the lab. There will be instructions for each lab (e.g., submit a screenshot and your code). --> 

The first part of the **Project** description and submission instructions will be available on 09/21/2021. Each of the three parts will be evaluated based on a high-level rubric to be provided with the project description, with more detail released as we progress through the parts. 

The **Exam** will consist of a mix of short and essay style questions. More detail will be shared later in the semester.

**Late Policy:** You can have three "late days" where you submit work a day late with no questions asked. You can use these for quizzes, labs, and projects part 1 & 2. After that, you will be penalised 5% per day late.

# Support & Policies

## Attendance Policy
This course is designed in a hybrid model, with some face-to-face meetings and others completed remotely. University policy states that students are expected to be present for every meeting of the classes in which they are enrolled. For the purposes of this course, being “present” means participating in-person or remotely as described in the course structure and completing work assigned for days when we do not meet face-to-face. This work is required to help you meet the course learning outcomes. These times count toward the course contact hours and your course grade. 

That said, this has been a complicated year, and you can contact me if you have any challenges/concerns with attending classes in-person. Guidance on class attendance related to COVID-19 are outlined in the [Protect Purdue Pledge](https://protect.purdue.edu/pledge/) for Fall 2021 on the Protect Purdue website. 

## Academic Guidance in the Event of Quarantine/Isolation
